- üå± My research interests lie in **agents based on large models (LLMs/MLMs)**. Specifically, I am interested in:
  - üîó **The integration of LMs with APIs (tools).**
  - üõ† **The software engineering challenges associated with the integration.**
  - üì± **The applications of LMs on edge devices.**
- üìö My [**research group**](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1025/2713.htm) primarily focuses on system software, including *machine learning systems*, *serverless computing*, *web systems*, *software engineering*, and etc. In my first year of Ph.D., I studied anomaly detection, federated learning, inference optimization for LLMs in the cloud, etc.
- üîç Throughout my studies from system software to deep learning, I have gained knowledge in various areas including *methods and applications of natural language processing*, *retrieval systems*, *data analysis and mining*, *acceleration*, and *application of machine learning systems*.
